According to copilot AI:
- body {height:100vh} doesn’t automatically make 
the grid fit inside that space — it makes the body 
the height of the viewport but still allows its 
children to overflow.
    - Also using body {width:100vw} in conjuction 
    with heightcan cause a horizontal scrollbar 
    when the vertical scrollbar consumes some of 
    the viewport width.

===========================================

- It might have to do with the virtual machine's
screen size, so let's try not using 
body{height:100vh} at all. Instead using 80vh or    
something.

- Maybe also the min-height property can be used.
