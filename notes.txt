According to copilot AI:
- body {height:100vh} doesn’t automatically make 
the grid fit inside that space — it makes the body 
the height of the viewport but still allows its 
children to overflow.
    - Also using body {width:100vw} in conjuction 
    with heightcan cause a horizontal scrollbar 
    when the vertical scrollbar consumes some of 
    the viewport width.

===========================================

- I believe that the CSS "aspect-ratio" property
was preventing the squares from shrinking 
vertically. It was attempting to keep the squares
dimensionally square.
