Extra credit:

1. Rather than squares being the same color 
throughout the grid, randomize the squaresâ€™ RGB 
values with each interaction.

2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening 
effect where each interaction darkens the square by 
10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black 
(or completely colored) square in only ten 
interactions.
    Hint: The opacity CSS property is useful here.
